CATAM material in Julia

This is the home page for creating the Julia materials for CATAM.


# Material

We hope to provide several documents, available as .jl (Pluto format) with PDF/HTML.  Movies could be made too (but take a lot of time).


1. [Introduction to Julia for CATAM](intro/README.md)
2. Conversion of 1A code.
3. Conversion of 1B Numerical analysis
4. 1B model code for [root-finding](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/catam/files/0pt1.pdf)
5. Case studies (see next section) to demonstrate different aspects of Julia

# Possible case studies

1. Logistic equation (for the introduction)
2. SIR model for disease spread
3. Four colour map theorem
4. Finding prime numbers
5. Matters of efficiency
6. Advantages of macros
7. Voronoi diagrams
8. Examples from John Hinch's new book on [fluid dynamics](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/fluid-dynamics-and-solid-mechanics/think-you-compute-prelude-computational-fluid-dynamics?format=PB)?  [code](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hinch/teaching/CMIFM_Handouts/)
9. Game of life
10. Automatic differentiation --> neural networks (gradient descent) [starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAp6nUMrKYg)
11. Something to read in large CSV data files/process/summarise / data analysis
12. Numerical optimisation?
