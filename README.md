# CATAM material in Julia

This is the home page for creating the Julia materials for Mathematics
students at the University of Cambridge.  As part of the degree,
students are encouraged to work on projects in
[CATAM](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/catam/computer-aided-teaching-all-mathematics-catam):
Computer-Aided Teaching of All Mathematics.  Currently, MATLAB is used
by most students, although students are free to use whichever language
they wish.  The aim of this project is to provide material suitable
for mathematicians to learn the key concepts of the
[Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language.


The material is divided into three sections: core material, case
studies and book examples.


# Core material

1. [Introduction to Julia for CATAM](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/intro/julia-manual.html)
2. [1A material](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/1a/)
3. [1B material](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/1b/)
4. [Root finding introductory project](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/introductoryproject/)

# Case studies

1. [Permutations](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Permutations)
2. [Modelling infectious diseases](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Modelling%20infectious%20diseases)
3. [Voronoi diagrams](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/voronoi)
4. [Lagrange points](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/lagrangepoints)
5. [Primes and efficiency](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Primes%20and%20Efficiency)
6. [Shuffles](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Shuffles)
7. [Image Processing](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Images)
8. [Random walks](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/randomwalks)

# Data-Driven Science and Engineering

We have examined a recent textbook published by CUP entitled
[Data-Driven Science and Engineering](https://databookuw.com) which
contains code in matlab and python.  We have converted the Matlab code
from Chapter 1 and most of Chapter 2 into Julia.  The conversion was
relatively quick the similarities between Julia and Matlab.  [Julia
