# Work in progress below


We hope to provide several documents, available as .jl (Pluto format)
with PDF/HTML.  Movies could be made too (but take a lot of time).

1. [Introduction to Julia for CATAM](intro/README.md) DONE
2. Conversion of [1A code](1a/README.md) NEEDS examples in Pluto
3. Conversion of 1B Numerical analysis UNDERWAY (3rd example)?
4. 1B model code for
   [root-finding](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/catam/files/0pt1.pdf) UNDERWAY @jmb280cam
5. Case studies (see next section) to demonstrate different aspects of Julia

## Possible case studies

1. Logistic equation (for the introduction)
2. SIR model for disease spread
3. Four colour map theorem
4. Finding prime numbers (Done)
5. Matters of efficiency (Gokul mentions maths macros `@simd`, `@fastmath`, `@inbounds` and column-major arrays in particular) (Done)
6. Advantages of macros
7. Voronoi diagrams (Done)
8. Examples from John Hinch's new book on [fluid dynamics](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/fluid-dynamics-and-solid-mechanics/think-you-compute-prelude-computational-fluid-dynamics?format=PB)?  [code](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hinch/teaching/CMIFM_Handouts/)
9. Game of life
10. Automatic differentiation --> neural networks (gradient descent) [starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAp6nUMrKYg)
11. Something to read in large CSV data files/process/summarise / data analysis
12. Numerical optimisation?
13. Turing patterns -- following tutorial by [Miura and Maini](https://paperpile.com/app/p/56e34cfe-cb76-07bd-ae2d-49dd9faad3b9)
14. Mandlebrot/Julia fractals
15. Statistics of card shuffles (Done)
16. RSA/Diffie-Hellman Encryption
17. Different approaches to approximate pi or e (monte carlo, series, continued fractions, etc.)
18. Perlin noise generation
19. Enumeration of Polyominoes
20. Finite projective geometry
21. A mention of type stability (link from Gokul https://www.juliabloggers.com/writing-type-stable-julia-code/)
