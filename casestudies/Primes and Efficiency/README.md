# Primes and Matters of Efficiency

[View case study](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Primes%20and%20Efficiency/primes.html)

**Objectives**
- Introduce ***asymptotic runtime analysis*** with "big O" notation 
- Compare different approaches for ***finding prime numbers*** in regard to their efficiency
- Measure runtimes experimentally with the ***runtime tools*** built into Julia
- Statistically varify certain theorems about the ***distribution of primes***
