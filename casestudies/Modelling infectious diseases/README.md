# Modelling infectious diseases

**Objectives**
- Create and compare two different ``SIR`` models for infectious disease
  - Mathematically, the classical ``SIR`` model given in terms of differential equations
  - Computationally, an ``SIR`` model considering proximity of individuals
- ***Consider methods of increasing efficiency in Julia code***
