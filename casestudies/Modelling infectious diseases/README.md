# Modelling infectious diseases

[View case study](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/casestudies/Modelling%20infectious%20diseases/Modelling%20infectious%20diseases.html)

**Objectives**
- Create and compare two different SIR models for infectious disease
  - Mathematically, the classical SIR model given in terms of differential equations
  - Computationally, an SIR model considering proximity of individuals
- ***Consider methods of increasing efficiency in Julia code***
