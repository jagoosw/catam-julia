# Book 'Data-Driven Science and Engineering'

Transcription of MATLAB code from the Book 'Data-Driven Science and Engineering' into Julia

Authors: Steven L. Brunton and J. Nathan Kutz

[Official Book Page](http://www.databookuw.com/)

Not all code has been translated, specifically code solely used for MATLAB formatting (.production files).

The easiest way to browse our Julia code for this book is to view the
files [directly on
github](https://github.com/sje30/catam-julia/edit/main/ddsae/).
Relevant data files are also included.  So far, material from all of
chapter 1 and most of chapter 2 has been converted.  As our project
has now finished (October 2021), we do not currently plan to convert
further examples.
