# 1B Numerical Analysis

We have looked at a few examples provided for the 1B Numerical
Analysis course.  The source [matlab examples](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/naweb/ib/) are available.

1. [Polynomial Interpretation](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/1b/Polynomial Interpolation/)
2. [Solving ODEs Numerically](https://sje30.github.io/catam-julia/1b/Solving ODEs Numerically/)
